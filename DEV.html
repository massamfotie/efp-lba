        <p>Dear Prime Minister</p>
        <p>Some weeks ago you paid us the honour of a visit, and we believe that you
            regard our work as important. You will have seen that, thanks largely to the
            energy and foresight of Commander Travis, we have been well supplied with the
            ‘bombes’ for the breaking of the German Enigma codes. We think, however, that
            you ought to know that this work is being held up, and in some cases is not being
            done at all, principally because we cannot get suYcient staV to deal with it. Our
            reason for writing to you direct is that for months we have done everything that
            we possibly can through the normal channels, and that we despair of any early
            improvement without your intervention. No doubt in the long run these particular requirements will be met, but meanwhile still more precious months will
            have been wasted, and as our needs are continually expanding we see little hope
            of ever being adequately staVed.

            <p>We realise that there is a tremendous demand for labour of all kinds and that
                its allocation is a matter of priorities. The trouble to our mind is that as we are a
                very small section with numerically trivial requirements it is very diYcult to
                bring home to the authorities Wnally responsible either the importance of what is
                done here or the urgent necessity of dealing promptly with our requests. At the
                same time we Wnd it hard to believe that it is really impossible to produce quickly
                the additional staV that we need, even if this meant interfering with the normal
                machinery of allocations.</p>

                We do not wish to burden you with a detailed list of our diYculties, but the
                    following are the bottlenecks which are causing us the most acute anxiety

                <br><p><b>1. Breaking of Naval Enigma (Hut 8)</b>
                </p>

                    Owing to shortage of staV and the overworking of his present team the Hollerith
                        section here under Mr Freeborn has had to stop working night shifts. The eVect
                        of this is that the Wnding of the naval keys is being delayed at least twelve hours
                        every day. In order to enable him to start night shifts again Freeborn needs
                        immediately about twenty more untrained Grade III women clerks. To put
                        himself in a really adequate position to deal with any likely demands he will
                        want a good many more.</p>

                        

                        <p>A further serious danger now threatening us is that some of the skilled male
                            staV, both with the British Tabulating Company at Letchworth and in Freeborn’s
                            section here, who have so far been exempt from military service, are now liable to
                            be called up.</p>

                            <br><p><b>2. Military and Air Force Enigma (Hut 6)</b></p>

                            <p>We are intercepting quite a substantial proportion of wireless traYc in the
                                Middle East which cannot be picked up by our intercepting stations here. This
                                contains among other things a good deal of new ‘Light Blue’ intelligence. Owing
                                to shortage of trained typists, however, and the fatigue of our present decoding staV, we cannot get all this traYc decoded. This has been the state of aVairs
                                since May. Yet all that we need to put matters right is about twenty trained
                                typists.</p>

                               <br> <p><b>3. Bombe testing, Hut 6 and Hut 8</b></p>

                                <p>In July we were promised that the testing of the ‘stories’ produced by the bombes
                                    would be taken over by the WRNS in the bombe hut and that suYcient WRNS
                                    would be provided for this purpose. It is now late in October and nothing
                                    has been done. We do not wish to stress this so strongly as the two preceding
                                    points, because it has not actually delayed us in delivering the goods. It has,
                                    however, meant that staV in Huts 6 and 8 who are needed for other jobs have
                                    had to do the testing themselves. We cannot help feeling that with a Service
                                    matter of this kind it should have been possible to detail a body of WRNS for
                                    this purpose, if suYciently urgent instructions had been sent to the right
                                    quarters.</p>


                                    <p><b>4</b>. Apart altogether from staV matters, there are a number of other directions
                                        in which it seems to us that we have met with unnecessary impediments. It
                                        would take too long to set these out in full, and we realise that some of the
                                        matters involved are controversial. The cumulative eVect, however, has been to
                                        drive us to the conviction that the importance of the work is not being impressed
                                        with suYcient force upon those outside authorities with whom we have to
                                        deal.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>We have written this letter entirely on our own initiative. We do not know
                                        who or what is responsible for our diYculties, and most emphatically we do
                                        not want to be taken as criticising Commander Travis who has all along done
                                        his utmost to help us in every possible way. But if we are to do our job as well
                                        as it could and should be done it is absolutely vital that our wants, small as they
                                        are, should be promptly attended to. We have felt that we should be failing in
